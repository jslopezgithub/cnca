# Volunteer Attendance Tracking
The purpose of the project is to create a website that allows for volunteers' attendance to be tracked.
## Current solution
The times are recorded in an Excel spreadsheet using macros and Visual Basic. The spreadsheet is shared among the work groups where it is used to verify the attendance, holidays, sick days and permits.
